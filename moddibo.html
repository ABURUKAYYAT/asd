                            <p>Hon. Ismail Musa Dan-Modibo, who is presently the Executive Council Chairman of Rafi Local Government Area, as well as an APC flag bearear for House of Representative, Refresenting Rafi, Shiroro, Munya consitituency in the
                                next year's (2023) general election is born and brouht up in Tegina, Rafi LGA, Niger State of Nigeria.</p>
                            <p>Dan'modibbo as he is popularly known, was born to the family of Late Alh Musa Idris Modibbo and Haj. Saratu Alhassan Tegina, more than 4 decades ago. His western educational journey began at Central Primary School Tegina between
                                1988 - 1993, and later to Government Secondary School Tegina (1994 to 2000) where he obtained his Primary and Secondary School leaving certificates respectively. While seeking for Western Education, he simultaneously acquired
                                Islamic Education from his family's Islamic School, hence vast in religious knowledge. Again within the same growing period, Dan'modibbo never relent to learn various skills and trades. Notable among was being a herdsman,
                                who periodically looked over his family's cattle, thus learnt the skills of livestock rearing and management.</p>

        <p class="mt-0">Dan'modibbo's political expertise began by the returned of democracy in 1999. Though was only an onlooker within the said period, as he was an amateur, who was keenly learning the rules and nitty-gritty of the game under PDP then . However, his
            political prominence came to limelight during the 2003 general election, when as one of the great members of opposition party then (PRP) gave the ruling party a fight of its time (even though narrowly lost to PDP). After which Dan'modibbo
            later returned to PDP, where many elections were contested and won along with him, until when he part way with PDP again in 2013/2014, after the party lost focus and directions. APC as a party (after the merger had been completed) started
            along with Dan'modibbo, as he was among the first set of people that accepted and nurtured the party from the cradle. Hence later gave birth to his emergence as it's State Organising Secretary (SOS). the position he held for almost 6 years
            (2014 -2019). Untill after he won the party's ticket to contest for Council Chairmanship. Where he eventually won the 2019 local government council polls to emerged as Executive Chairman of Rafi Local Government (the position he holds till
            date). He also recently won an APC ticket in the just concluded parties primary election, to emerged as the party's flag bearer for member House of Representative, representing Rafi Shiroro Munya Constituency, in the next coming general election
            (February 2023). Away from politics, Dan'modibbo is a great farmer (of both crops and livestock), and also a business mugul. His enterprises cut across very many legitimate ventures. For instance, his registered company (Dan'modibbo and Sons
            Ltd) is mostly engages in construction and food supply, apart from other petty tradings like KAYAN GWARI. In fact, Dan'modibbo is the type that never like idleness, that is why he is always up and doing, and strive for best out of his precious
            time. Some of the attributes that makes Dan'modibbo differs from other politicians is honesty, straightforwardness and fearless on all matters of his own convictions. And above all, his ability to view political positions as a duty and total
            service to humanity, not a means for self enrichment. A testimony proved by the uncountable lives he touches and the numbers of people's oriented programs and projects he executed in the last 8 years of his stewardship as both party's State
            Organising Secretary and Council Chairman Rafi LGA.
